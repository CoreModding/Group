A few resources to read when you have free time.

Bloch, Joshua "Effective Java" http://bit.ly/1cQrWjD
"This book consists of seventy-eight items, each of which conveys one rule. 
The rules capture practices generally held to be beneficial by the best and 
most experienced programmers."

Martin, Robert C. "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship" http://bit.ly/1fpQzhx
"Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a 
development organization to its knees. But it doesn’t have to be that way."
